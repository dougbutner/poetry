# You Can't Eat Money

So tell me whats made up,

And whats real,

Is it all perception, cause I know what I feel,

**Feel.**

Politics and government, aren’t made of atomicness,

The names are ours, the subjects anonymous,

But they tell me,

Money, Money, Me Me Money money Me

Well you can’t eat money,

but I need it to eat?,

Funny, all my food from the Sun and the sea,

I am tuned in, moving wind with my trees,

I breathe in to all I believe,

I am him, I am her, I am love, I am we,

**I Am We.**
