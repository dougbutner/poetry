**If life is but a dream,** what happens when you wake, 

I imagine you arrive inside a picturesque place,

And maybe this life is the heaven that was promised,

And every day of God’s blessing is now upon us,

And what happens to our beliefs when we die,

besides blissfulness restricted when we were living our lives,

So why not believe we are gods beneath the sky,

so a part of them can shine through you and I,

The true white fire,
___

And what if how we lived our lives could change our DNA, 

and we could pass the changes to our kids to live the same, 

What if it all mattered, what if nothing did, 

and could both be true or must just one to exist, 

Why are the fanciest dresses never worn, 

what if black holes are where our universe is born,

## Bonus Section (From below these lyrics in my rhyme book)

I’m in love with the idea of love,

A connection so pure, truth can exist as subjective no more,

But one, unifies all around the love will collide,

Here we are like the stars by a moon in the sky,
