# The Loving Golden Light (Poem)

## Let the stars play in the heavens, 
 ##conduct the symphony with silent night,


Let the stars play in the heavens, 

conduct the symphony with silent night, 

We no longer call it magic, 

these are miracles of highest light, 

Twisting information, 

Iâ€™m spinning like a helix,

realigning with center, 

white column inside, I feel it,

___

White fire always alive, 
in the now that we arrive,
This golden light, this vibe 
that rides life into the sky, 
so we will never die,
___

Change forms, change norms,
___

This golden light, this vibe, 

I feel it in my heart, 

And instantly I fly,

I am now all-over, 

Sun shining golden face, 

connecting all things living, 

a loving guiding trace, 

of all that is within us, you are I and I are we, 

So even in the darkest night, the heart inside can see.
