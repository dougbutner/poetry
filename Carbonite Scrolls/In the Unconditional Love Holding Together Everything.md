# In The Unconditional Love holding together everything


I been staring at the light for a long time,

So long the sane mind gone blind, 

The same mind that bind to this frame, I, 

Gave mine a vessel and became time,

I close my eyes, two, open up my eye, 

Sacrifice my body for a ride, 
> #On the infinite vibe, and when inside, 
> #Love and light collide, 
> #nowhere for fear to hide,
> #Eclipse of clear mind, the far and near shine, 
> #distance becomes time, and time is combined, 
> #leaving and returning to where everything collides;
> # Iâ€™m alive, in love,
> #Literally floating in love,
> #Funny but I never miss it,
> # Glimpse it all as an instant, 
> #Within us, heaven is persistent, 
> #Wishin, I could share everything, 
> #More than one soul could ever see, 
> #In the Unconditional love holding together everything
