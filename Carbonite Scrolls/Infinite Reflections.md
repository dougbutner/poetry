# Infinite Reflections

The lessons I am teaching I am learning while I’m breathing,

I am changing like the seasons, I am growing I am reaching,

**I am lost in the eye** but I need to see wide,

through the people and their vibes, we are one you and I,

**So who am I speaking as, who am I speaking to,**

what are these illusionary barriers that’s keeping you,

From shining as the dust of a star that's completing you,

Sun of the God that is dying just to speak to you,

**and living just to breathe through you,**

**These word here are seeking you,**

but light must be seen by you, that you can bring meaning to,

the feeling of pure love, timeless and seamless too,

the beauty of one no words can complete the view,

and when you see the light its not something you can keep to you,

Share the love whole and know you receive it true,

Seems that every path you take you complete the route,

believe in love, I believe in you,

Feel the most high we are speaking through,

### one love,

## Peace
