# The Free Hippie

I sold all my trinkets for clean water, traded my clothes for some air to breathe,

I took off my shoes when I saw the forest, to let my spirit dance with the trees,

I have no grudge against the system, all I really want is peace,

You see, Iâ€™m not afraid of death any more, it makes every life complete.
