# Three Phases of Evolution


## Phase 1

In love with being alive, find solace with the stars,

Until I’m fallen apart, I’ll put cause in my paws,

Far farther than Mars, bard Bert with some bars,

I write invisible ink that heals permeant scars,

## Phase 2

Fortified with holy poltergeist, and hope to heal the masses,

Live according to a council more valiant than the Vatican,

A phoenix in fine fashion, filling crystalline chalices,

With flowers for the sacrament, and stars in the talisman,

Align with constellations magnetically accurate,

Journey as a man till my free will masters it

Aten and baskin, pray to every star and atom,

I never fear attachment, to let live is my passion,

## Phase 3

On the density where mice and elephants find balances,

And flesh and bone are palaces, Wiped clear from the memories,

but guided to our path on the guidance from the masters,

Till the bones are only ashes,

My spirit flows on,
