# Carbon Cycle 

Burn the trash, recycle the carbon,  

Spread the seeds, for some still starving,  

Walk a way, when the fake man speak,  

For the world grows love, as fear grows weak,
___
Illusions they fade, no power they have,  

When light shines true, no side is bad,  

Just one evolution of heart past a mind,  

To look past the physical and be all as time,
___

You are the Christ now, the infinite one,  

Inside you will feel the change thatâ€™s begun,  

When earth shakes the love rises infinite peaks,  

the columns of light now the trees will they speak,
___
And all of the while a network is built,  

And sails of the light leave all empty ports filled,  

For we are vibrations with chemical frames,  

The glands now will change you and heighten your brain,
___
Your mission is here now remember the book,  

The bodies you had and the time that you took,  

No words will remind you, just meanings behind,  

All now you are child of light train your mind,
___
For here is the space in which heroes make time,  

Four heroes in space take the now and align,
