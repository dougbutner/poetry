# Rainbow Ways

It’s been a long time since I felt this way, 
but I feel its a long climb before it breaks the day,
and when I’m at the top I’ll know the clouds true shape, 
and I can laugh and listen as the echoes play,

 
And maybe I’ll phase shift to my rainbow ways, float around that mountain in the sacred space, 
the layer between the water and the air collide, 
and awaken with the light that touches from the sky.
