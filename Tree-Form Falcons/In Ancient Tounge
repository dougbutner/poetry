I am the prophet the old ones seek,

But they will never recognize me, 

For my children are lost, 

Still I am their loving king, 

Still I am generous in this abundance handed to me,

This is the way of all who walk the path,

So I will create a new nation, and father new children, 

Children of ideas that being light, and light that takes bodies, 

And all of my children that hold themselves worthy, 

Will walk with me in the land of milk and honey,
