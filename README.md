# This is Poetry
In [Carbonite scrolls](https://github.com/dougbutner/poetry/tree/master/Carbonite%20Scrolls), you will find a shattered scroll of ancient knowledge, painstaikingly reconstructed with tape made of the wind. 


In [Pigeons from the Path](https://github.com/dougbutner/poetry/tree/master/Pidgeons%20from%20the%20Path) you will see a flock of pidgeons departing from the places they once stood, taking a journey across the world, never to return to the unknown dark box they were born.
