In [Carbonite scrolls](https://github.com/dougbutner/poetry/tree/master/Carbonite%20Scrolls), you will find a shattered scroll of ancient knowledge, painstaikingly reconstructed with tape made of the wind. 


In [Pigeons from the Path](https://github.com/dougbutner/poetry/tree/master/Pidgeons%20from%20the%20Path) you will see a flock of pigeons departing from the places they once stood, taking a journey across the world, never to return to the unknown dark box they were born. 


[Tree form flacons] fly the sky, absorbing the information through multisensory experience. Upon return, the visit the shaman of the tree people, and into the eyes and sould of the falcon soes the shaman see. Unfiltered. Unformatted.
