# This is Poetry
In [Carbonite Scrolls](https://github.com/dougbutner/poetry/tree/master/Carbonite%20Scrolls), you will find a shattered scroll of ancient knowledge, painstakingly reconstructed with tape made of the wind. 


In [Pigeons from the Path](https://github.com/dougbutner/poetry/tree/master/Pidgeons%20from%20the%20Path) you will see a flock of pigeons departing from the places they once stood, taking a journey across the world, never to return to the unknown dark box they were born. 


[Tree-Form Falcons](https://github.com/dougbutner/poetry/tree/master/Tree-Form%20Falcons) fly the sky, absorbing the information through multi-sensory experience. Upon return, the visit the shaman of the tree people, and into the eyes and soul, the falcon learns, and the shaman sees. Unfiltered. Unformatted.
